abstract: 'Word Meaning Negotiation (WMN) sequences occur when participants focus
  on clarifying or negotiating the meaning of a word or phrase, often prompted by
  questions or challenges. These interactions temporarily shift the conversation to
  explore nuances of meaning - sometimes resulting in quick clarification when due
  to insufficient understanding of word meaning, and other times leading to extended
  debates, such as disagreements on what a word can or should mean.  This paper presents
  the largest and freely available manually annotated corpus of WMNs to date, encompassing
  spoken dyadic and multiparty conversations as well as online discussions. Our methodology
  combines searching for WMNs using regular expressions with a detailed annotation
  scheme that categorizes WMNs into types triggered by non-understanding (NONs: Non-understanding
  WMN) or disagreement (DINs: Disagreement WMN), and distinguishes between negotiations
  of situated and potential meanings. We also annotate incomplete negotiations and
  related phenomena, and analyze inter-annotator agreement to evaluate the reliability
  of the annotation schema. Preliminary investigations of WMNs in the corpus reveal
  distinct patterns in WMNs across contexts, with NONs prevalent in spoken interactions
  and DINs dominating online debates. This resource lays a foundation for studying
  semantic alignment, developing automated WMN detection, and creating adaptive dialogue
  systems. Our findings highlight the complexity of WMNs and provide practical insights
  for their identification and analysis.'
