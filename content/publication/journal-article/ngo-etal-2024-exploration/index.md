abstract: In daily conversations, people often encounter problems prompting conversational
  repair to enhance mutual understanding. By employing an automatic coreference solver,
  alongside examining repetition, we identify various linguistic features that distinguish
  turns when the addressee initiates repair from those when they do not. Our findings
  reveal distinct patterns that characterize the repair sequence and each type of
  repair initiation.
