abstract: 'Socio-conversational systems are dialogue systems, including what are sometimes
  referred to as chatbots, vocal assistants, social robots, and embodied conversational
  agents, that are capable of interacting with humans in a way that treats both the
  specifically social nature of the interaction and the content of a task. The aim
  of this paper is twofold: 1) to uncover some places where the compartmentalized
  nature of research conducted around socio-conversational systems creates problems
  for the field as a whole, and 2) to propose a way to overcome this compartmentalization
  and thus strengthen the capabilities of socio-conversational systems by defining
  common challenges. Specifically, we examine research carried out by the signal processing,
  natural language processing and dialogue, machine/deep learning, social/affective
  computing and social sciences communities. We focus on three major challenges for
  the development of effective socio-conversational systems, and describe ways to
  tackle them.'
