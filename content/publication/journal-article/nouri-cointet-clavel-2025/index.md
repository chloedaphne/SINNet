abstract: Detecting abusive language in social media conversations poses significant
  challenges, as identifying abusiveness often depends on the conversational context,
  characterized by the content and topology of preceding comments. Traditional Abusive
  Language Detection (ALD) models often overlook this context, which can lead to unreliable
  performance metrics. Recent Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods that integrate
  conversational context often depend on limited and simplified representations, and
  report inconsistent results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that utilize
  graph neural networks (GNNs) to model social media conversations as graphs, where
  nodes represent comments, and edges capture reply structures. We systematically
  investigate various graph representations and context windows to identify the optimal
  configuration for ALD. Our GNN model outperform both context-agnostic baselines
  and linear context-aware methods, achieving significant improvements in F1 scores.
  These findings demonstrate the critical role of structured conversational context
  and establish GNNs as a robust framework for advancing context-aware abusive language
  detection.
