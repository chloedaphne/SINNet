@article{Clavel_Labeau_Cassell_2022, title={Socio-conversational systems: Three challenges at the crossroads of fields}, volume={9}, ISSN={2296-9144}, url={https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2022.937825/full}, DOI={10.3389/frobt.2022.937825}, abstract={Socio-conversational systems are dialogue systems, including what are sometimes referred to as chatbots, vocal assistants, social robots, and embodied conversational agents, that are capable of interacting with humans in a way that treats both the specifically social nature of the interaction and the content of a task. The aim of this paper is twofold: 1) to uncover some places where the compartmentalized nature of research conducted around socio-conversational systems creates problems for the field as a whole, and 2) to propose a way to overcome this compartmentalization and thus strengthen the capabilities of socio-conversational systems by defining common challenges. Specifically, we examine research carried out by the signal processing, natural language processing and dialogue, machine/deep learning, social/affective computing and social sciences communities. We focus on three major challenges for the development of effective socio-conversational systems, and describe ways to tackle them.}, journal={Frontiers in Robotics and AI}, publisher={Frontiers}, author={Clavel, Chloé and Labeau, Matthieu and Cassell, Justine}, year={2022}, month=dec, language={English} }

Traditional Abusive Language Detection (ALD) models often overlook this context, which can lead to unreliable performance metrics. Recent Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches that incorporate conversational context often rely on limited or overly simplified representations of this context, leading to inconsistent and sometimes inconclusive results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) to model social media conversations as graphs, where nodes represent comments, and edges capture reply structures. We systematically investigate various graph representations and context windows to identify the optimal configurations for ALD. Our GNN model outperforms both context-agnostic baselines and linear context-aware methods, achieving significant improvements in F1 scores. These findings demonstrate the critical role of structured conversational context and establish GNNs as a robust framework for advancing context-aware ALD.}, booktitle={Proceedings of the 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)}, publisher={Association for Computational Linguistics}, author={Nouri, Célia and Cointet, Jean-Philippe and Clavel, Chloé}, editor={Che, Wanxiang and Nabende, Joyce and Shutova, Ekaterina and Pilehvar, Mohammad Taher}, year={2025}, month={July}, pages={18271–18286} }

  title={The NeWMe Corpus: A gold standard corpus for the study of Word Meaning Negotiation}, 
  url={https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-5975927/v1}, 
  abstract={Word Meaning Negotiation (WMN) sequences occur when participants focus on clarifying or negotiating the meaning of a word or phrase, often prompted by questions or challenges. These interactions temporarily shift the conversation to explore nuances of meaning - sometimes resulting in quick clarification when due to insufficient understanding of word meaning, and other times leading to extended debates, such as disagreements on what a word can or should mean. 
  This paper presents the largest and freely available manually annotated corpus of WMNs to date, encompassing spoken dyadic and multiparty conversations as well as online discussions. Our methodology combines searching for WMNs using regular expressions with a detailed annotation scheme that categorizes WMNs into types triggered by non-understanding (NONs: Non-understanding WMN) or disagreement (DINs: Disagreement WMN), and distinguishes between negotiations of situated and potential meanings. We also annotate incomplete negotiations and related phenomena, and analyze inter-annotator agreement to evaluate the reliability of the annotation schema.
  Preliminary investigations of WMNs in the corpus reveal distinct patterns in WMNs across contexts, with NONs prevalent in spoken interactions and DINs dominating online debates. This resource lays a foundation for studying semantic alignment, developing automated WMN detection, and creating adaptive dialogue systems. Our findings highlight the complexity of WMNs and provide practical insights for their identification and analysis.},

    abstract = "Designing emotionally intelligent conversational systems to provide comfort and advice to people experiencing distress is a compelling area of research. Recently, with advancements in large language models (LLMs), end-to-end dialogue agents without explicit strategy prediction steps have become prevalent. However, implicit strategy planning lacks transparency, and recent studies show that LLMs' inherent preference bias towards certain socio-emotional strategies hinders the delivery of high-quality emotional support. To address this challenge, we propose decoupling strategy prediction from language generation, and introduce a novel dialogue strategy prediction framework, EmoDynamiX, which models the discourse dynamics between user fine-grained emotions and system strategies using a heterogeneous graph for better performance and transparency. Experimental results on two ESC datasets show EmoDynamiX outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with a significant margin (better proficiency and lower preference bias). Our approach also exhibits better transparency by allowing backtracing of decision making."

Our findings reveal distinct patterns that characterize the repair sequence and each type of repair initiation."
