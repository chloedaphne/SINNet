abstract: Designing emotionally intelligent conversational systems to provide comfort
  and advice to people experiencing distress is a compelling area of research. Recently,
  with advancements in large language models (LLMs), end-to-end dialogue agents without
  explicit strategy prediction steps have become prevalent. However, implicit strategy
  planning lacks transparency, and recent studies show that LLMs' inherent preference
  bias towards certain socio-emotional strategies hinders the delivery of high-quality
  emotional support. To address this challenge, we propose decoupling strategy prediction
  from language generation, and introduce a novel dialogue strategy prediction framework,
  EmoDynamiX, which models the discourse dynamics between user fine-grained emotions
  and system strategies using a heterogeneous graph for better performance and transparency.
  Experimental results on two ESC datasets show EmoDynamiX outperforms previous state-of-the-art
  methods with a significant margin (better proficiency and lower preference bias).
  Our approach also exhibits better transparency by allowing backtracing of decision
  making.
