I'm a first-year PhD candidate at ALMAnaCH (Inria Paris), co-supervised by Chloé Clavel and Maria Boritchev. My research focuses on automatic analysis of human capacity in collaboration.

I obtained my engineer degree from INSA ROUEN in 2016, major in Information System Architecture (ASI) with a specialty in Machine Learning. I obtained a master degree in the same year in Multimedia Information Processing System (STIM) from University of Rouen. Before applying to my PhD study in 2024, i worked on NLP application in industry. My experience spans document classification, information retrieval, and client relationship management systems, with a strong emphasis on building scalable, real-world solutions.

My current interests lie at the intersection of language, cognition, and technology. I'm particularly driven by questions around how machines can better model the nuances of human interaction and collaborative behavior through language. This includes analyzing discourse patterns, intent recognition, and the dynamics of dialogue in multi-agent or human-machine teams.
